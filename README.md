# Material Loading Indicator

Some fun with `Core Animation` - making an Android-inspired, material loading indicator.

Been learning some `CALayer` and 	`Core Animation` fundamentals recently. This little project is based on a great tutorial by Matthew Cheok on implementing an [Android-inspired, material-style loading indicator](http://blog.matthewcheok.com/design-teardown-spinning-indicator/), with some minor parameterization and re-factoring. 

Inspired by a [recent episode](https://www.raywenderlich.com/130638/playgrounds-scenekit-revisited) of the Ray Wenderlich podcast, I implemented this in Swift playground format to build a little more familiarity with leveraging playgrounds to run and test little bits of code, and playgrounds are more powerful than ever since Apple introduced interactive playgrounds with Xcode 7.3. Another neat feature of playgrounds is how markdown can be utilized to embed rich, formatted text (and hyperlinks) to make your playground comments really come to life. The project also also contains a few other tutorial and blog references I came across on the subject of iOS animations in general.
